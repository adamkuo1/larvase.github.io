                    <p class="text">
                        Our education program focuses on three ideas often overlooked: synthetic biology, the black
                        soldier fly (BSF), and food waste. Synthetic biology is evolving at a rapid pace, yet many
                        people still associate it with some sort of chemical hazard. The black soldier fly larvae
                        (BSFL), which are useful in food waste management, are often dismissed because they look
                        intimidating. Food waste, despite being a global issue, seldom receives attention.<br>
                        To change these views, our educational program offers lessons suited to different age groups and
                        communities. The materials that we designed are adapted for different age groups, public events,
                        and online platforms, making the topics more accessible. At our core, we aim to raise awareness
                        and change people’s perception of these challenges.<br>
                        <br>
                        Education plan: 15<br>

                        Total education activity:<br>
                        <br>
                        Education has always been reciprocal. Reflecting on this idea, our education section is divided
                        into four parts: beginning with learning from others, followed by adaptive education, then
                        immersive learning, and finally, voices and networks. This sequence reflects the crux of
                        education: from <b>gaining knowledge</b>, to <b>tailoring it</b>, to <b>making it engaging</b>,
                        and finally, to
                        amplifying its reach.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b style="color:#ff8210; font-size: 1.4rem;">1. Learning From Others</b><br>
                        Before teaching others, we first focused on learning ourselves. This involved attending
                        conferences, open lab days, and expert talks to deepen our understanding of synthetic biology,
                        BSF, and general enzyme engineering. By listening to professors, researchers, and industry
                        stakeholders, we gained valuable information on how to shape both our project design and our
                        education strategies.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b style="color:#ff8210; font-size: 1.4rem;">2. Adaptive Education</b><br>
                        We adapted our teaching plans to accommodate different audiences from kindergarten students to
                        secondary level students. We also considered elderly learners and international learners in Sri
                        Lanka and Vietnam. Each program was designed with specific methods to match the learning
                        abilities and cultural context of the group. This approach ensured accessibility and
                        inclusiveness.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b style="color:#ff8210; font-size: 1.4rem;">3. Immersive Learning</b><br>
                        Our focus here was to create active learning experiences rather than passive listening. We
                        designed activities such as BioQuest and Empty Plate, as well as interactive events at school
                        science fairs. These programs encouraged students to play, solve problems, and actively
                        participate in their own learning.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b style="color:#ff8210; font-size: 1.4rem;">4. Voices and Netweoks</b><br>
                        Education also meant amplifying voices beyond the classroom. We launched podcasts, published
                        magazines, and created social media campaigns to reach broader audiences. These platforms turned
                        education into a dialogue, where we shared our ideas and also learned from the feedback of
                        others.<br>

                    <p class="text">
                        To guide others effectively, we first focused on deepening our own understanding. To strengthen
                        our
                        project, we received guidance from experts and the research community. Academic conferences,
                        college
                        lab visits, and expert gatherings have expanded our knowledge in synthetic biology, enzyme
                        engineering, and BSF research. These experiences widened the scientific perspective of our team
                        and
                        introduced approaches that could be carried into our own project. In addition, informal
                        conversations with professors, researchers, and industry leaders gave us inspiration that later
                        guided both our lab work and human practices.<br>

                    <p class="text">
                        National Taiwan University (NTU), as the best university in Taiwan, stands as a key hub for
                        synthetic biology research. During the Lab Open Day, visitors are introduced to projects in
                        genetic engineering and related fields. For us, this event offered a chance to learn about the
                        latest techniques and strategies that might strengthen our project. The event also facilitated
                        connections with professors who went on to serve as external advisors to our project.<br>
                        <br>
                        Conversations with professors revealed the challenges of biosafety concerns. For instance,
                        during a conversation with Professor Yang, a synthetic biology researcher at NTU, it washe noted
                        that some people still doubt the role of biotech in the future. Yet, he expressed confidence
                        that, as time approaches, a new generation would demonstrate how synthetic biology could
                        contribute to the world. He also shared advice on how to find and read academic papers more
                        efficiently, guidance that felt especially valuable for students like us who are still learning
                        in the field of research.<br>
                        <br>
                        The Lab Open Day provided a clearer understanding of what a dry lab entails. Researchers
                        demonstrated their approaches, including the use of AlphaFold, Rosetta, and other computational
                        tools. For a high school team with limited access to such resources, seeing these methods was
                        especially advantageous. The experience showed us how dry lab work complements wet lab
                        experiments. Overall, the event offered models of practice that could be adapted to strengthen
                        our own project.<br>

                    The insights gained from the BSF conference directly impact our wet lab. We refined our design to
                    emphasize cellulase-based pretreatment, targeting the breakdown of fibrous components in food waste
                    before larval ingestion. Guidance from Dr. Jeffery K. Tomberlin, Professor of Entomology at Texas
                    A&M University and Director of the National Science Foundation Center for Insect Biomanufacturing
                    and Innovation, who specializes in BSF research, suggested the need to prioritize enzymes that can
                    function in environments similar to compost piles, where temperature and pH fluctuate. The
                    conference also emphasized the role of industry collaboration, motivating our team to expand
                    stakeholder outreach on practical application within BSF farming systems, aligning with industry
                    expectations and environmental goals.<br>

                    </h2>
                    <br>
                    We attended the 2025 Taiwan Year Seminar to help with our understanding of synthetic biology as a
                    whole. The seminar discussed chromatin dynamics, mitochondrial function, nuclear envelope assembly,
                    ER-associated degradation, sexual reproduction in yeast species. Yeast, similar to E. coli, is a
                    widely used host organism in genetic engineering, while our project focuses on employing E. coli to
                    produce enzymes at scale. By joining the meeting, we aimed to explore concepts that are new to
                    us.<br>
                    <br>
                    We learned that yeast is engineered to produce compounds such as biofuels and food supplements. A
                    key takeaway for us was the process of how researchers optimize gene expression in yeast. The
                    meeting also emphasized the challenges of building stable systems, including the need to balance
                    metabolic loads and maintain the functions over cultures. Granted, as high school students, we could
                    not fully understand the concept, but we did our best to learn and take notes on what we were not
                    familiar with.<br>

                    Although the content of the Yeast Conference was not directly linked to our project, it still
                    offered helpful guidance. Hearing about yeast pathways reminded us of the importance of carefully
                    selecting signal peptides and promoters to maximize expression levels in our own enzyme secretion
                    system.<br>

                    After receiving guidance ourselves, we felt a responsibility and an urge to share knowledge with
                    others. “Education for all,” a principle rooted in Confucian thought, emphasized the importance of
                    making knowledge accessible to everyone. With this idea in mind, our team adopted the “Backward
                    Design” framework to ensure our program would be inclusive for audiences of different ages and
                    backgrounds. This teaching method, introduced by Wiggins and McTighe in the book Understanding by
                    Design, is an educational method that places learners at the center of course planning.<br>
                    <br>
                    We divided our target audience into distinct age groups: kindergarten, elementary school, junior
                    high school, and the elderly. This separation of each group could receive materials tailored to
                    their level of understanding.<br>

                    <br>
                    In our education plan for kindergarteners, the goal was to gently introduce the issue of food waste
                    and show how BSF can help address it. At this age, children are naturally curious about familiar
                    things (such as food) which makes the topic relatable and imaginable for kids. Building on that
                    curiosity, we used metaphors heavily to demonstrate the abstract ideas. We presented BSF as
                    “helpers” that “consume food waste and clean the Earth,” framing insects as small heroes for our
                    planet.<br>
                    <br>
                    Through simple narratives and illustrations, children were encouraged to see themselves as
                    “mini-scientists”. Along the way, they were introduced to the idea that living organisms have
                    different roles in nature, with BSF uniquely suited to tackle food waste.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b style="color:#ff8210; font-size: 1.4rem;">Program</b><br>
                    <br>
                    To engage our youngest audience, we transformed the idea of enzymes that help with food waste
                    leftovers into a storybook adventure. The centerpiece was “Bob the Black Soldier Fly,” a comic-style
                    character illustrated with bold colors and expressive faces. We created an eight-panel comic
                    narrated by our team, allowing children to follow the storyline visually while listening to the
                    narration.<br>
                    <br>
                    We consulted kindergarten teachers experienced in working with young children, who advised us to
                    rely on images with minimal oral explanation. As a result, we created Bob and his friends, E.coli
                    Tim and Bacillus subtilis Sam, on an adventure. The comic introduced the core ideas of our project
                    through engaging stories to children’s imaginations.<br>

                        In one of our kindergarten programs, the Principal American School (pre-school), required us to
                        use only English, even though the children’s first language was Mandarin. This made it
                        challenging to express scientific concepts at their level of English proficiency (merely five
                        years old!). We simplified our language use, relied more on illustrations, and incorporated
                        YouTube videos to support their understanding.<br>

                    comic. Together, these activities combined visuals and narrative to make learning about BSF

                        <br>
                        Our goal with elementary students was to introduce the BSF project in ways that connect directly
                        to their daily lives. But, unlike the kindergarten program, which relied heavily on storytelling
                        and imagination, this stage allowed us to go further: guiding elementary students into the world
                        of biology by linking scientific ideas to experiences they have already recognized. Since
                        Taiwan’s national curriculum introduces basic science concepts beginning in grade three of
                        elementary school (approximately 9 years old), we were able to frame our teaching in ways that
                        matched what students were already learning.<br>

                        Also, recognizing that elementary school children are often more energetic and harder to keep
                        focused, we prepared a variety of group activities, such as interactive songs and board games,
                        to channel their energy while teaching.<br>

                        <br>
                        Scratch is a free, beginner-friendly programming platform widely used in Taiwanese elementary
                        schools as part of information technology classes. Instead of requiring written code, Scratch
                        uses visual blocks, like digital LEGO, to represent actions or settings for characters and
                        scenes.
                        For instance, purple blocks can make a character speak, move, or disappear, while blue blocks
                        control the background. This simplicity makes Scratch especially engaging for youth. By creating
                        a
                        Scratch video, we introduced our project and biology concepts through a platform children were
                        already
                        familiar with, allowing them to interact by controlling Bob and even adding their own creative
                        elements to the story, which deepened their impression of the session.<br>

                    <p class="text">
                        The video introduces BSF as a solution to food waste, while also addressing one of the key
                        challenges: breaking down fiber. We explained that through synthetic biology, E. coli (Tim) and
                        Bacillus subtilis (Sam) can work together to produce endoglucanase, an enzyme (represented by a
                        pair of scissors) that cuts down fiber and makes BSFL digestion more efficient.

                            We organized a two-day camp for elementary school students called One For All, with the dual
                            goal of introducing synthetic biology concepts and cultivating leadership and presentation
                            skills. To make the camp possible, we recruited over 30 volunteers and brought the program
                            to Chang Keng Elementary School, a rural public school in Taiwan with no more than 100
                            students. The schedule was designed to balance science and personal growth. Each day
                            featured two hours of courses focused on our project and biology, while the rest of the time
                            was devoted to leadership-building activities like “escape room”, drama performing, and
                            other outdoor activities.<br>

                            we showed pictures of common examples—school lunch leftovers, discarded night market food,

                            large bags of unsold vegetables from traditional markets. Afterward, students used clay to
                            recreate items they had seen in the images. This activity reinforced and encouraged them to
                            reflect on the value of food and the importance of reducing waste in daily life.<br>

                            recessive traits as well as the basics of blood types. Our main activity was “Little Gene
                            Detective”. Students were shown pictures of dogs of different breeds and asked to write down
                            their observed features on separate notes. These notes were then placed into a “mystery
                            box,”
                            from which each student randomly drew traits to design their own imaginary pet. Through this
                            process, they experienced how genetic traits are inherited randomly and how they shape
                            appearance. The activity was aimed to reinforce their understanding of genetics and also
                            encourage their collaboration skill when analysing the different appearances of dogs.<br>

                            As we transitioned to junior and senior high school students, our goal shifted towards
                            promoting a deeper understanding of synthetic biology. Topics included gene cloning and the
                            integration of lab and hardware technologies. Certainly, we explained the reasoning behind
                            our focus on BSF and provided information about its unique life cycle.<br>
                            <br>
                            Recognizing that a simple introduction would not be enough to engage older students, we also
                            shared our own lab experiences. This session became a vital part of our project design,
                            capturing student interest by walking them through key concepts such as extracting genes
                            from organisms, amplifying DNA using PCR, and engineering genes in different ways. Besides
                            synthetic biology, we emphasized the importance of sustainability and demonstrated how our
                            work connects to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b style="color:#ff8210; font-size: 1.4rem;">Methods</b><br>
                            <br>
                            For junior and senior students, we designed materials that matched their ability to engage
                            with greater detail. One was a custom teaching card deck, styled like poker cards, with each
                            card featuring a graphic from our project. These cards supported group activities and memory
                            challenges, helping students retain abstract terms more easily.<br>
                            <br>
                            <u>We organized two games using our custom teaching card deck:</u><br>
                            <br>
                            1. If the facilitator called out “3 DNA times 5 E. coli plus 10 enzymes,” the player would
                            need
                            to quickly find them and do the math. The challenge was not as easy as it sounds, which made
                            the students even more engaged in the activity.<br>
                            2. Each student received one card representing part of the elements of our project, such as
                            DNA, E. coli, enzymes, and food waste. The facilitator would then announce a “mission,” for
                            example, “2 DNA plus 3 E. coli to produce one enzyme,” or “1 enzyme plus 2 food waste to
                            complete decomposition.” Students had to quickly search through each other’s cards to
                            assemble the correct combination.<br>

                            For the elders, our teaching method differed from that used with students. Since their
                            familiarity with scientific concepts was generally lower, we adopted a style closer to our
                            kindergarten program. We used simple, image-based slides instead of text materials without
                            overwhelming detail. To make the session more interactive, we apply the same card game, in
                            which each character represents a different element in our project.<br>

                            It was not an easy task to take care of 30 elderly participants with only a few members of
                            our
                            human practice team. Before the program, we consulted the nursing home staff to learn how to
                            look after them properly. From these conversations, we discovered that their cognitive
                            abilities
                            were roughly comparable to a 7-year-old kid, though with one important difference: most of
                            them
                            could barely understand Mandarin and were more accustomed to speaking in traditional
                            Taiwanese.
                            For us, a group of Gen Z students used to communicating mainly in Mandarin, this language
                            barrier became one of the main challenges since only a few of us could attempt to speak in
                            Taiwanese.<br>
                            <br>
                            Even so, we didn’t give up. We practiced, rewrote our materials, and ensured that everything
                            was
                            clear. Eventually, we confirmed the teaching date and visited several local community
                            centers
                            where many elders gathered. They were amazed at how we used metaphors and simple
                            visualization
                            to explain concepts that initially seemed difficult. Ms. Chang and Mr. Chien, who were
                            nearly 90
                            years old from Yong He Nursing Home, admitted it was their very first time receiving
                            teaching,
                            as they had never had the chance to attend school before. In a sense, we were offering a
                            first
                            experience of education to those who had missed such opportunities earlier in life.<br>
                            <br>
                            We were quite nervous at first, unsure of how the elderly would react to our presentation.
                            But
                            as we spoke, we noticed them listening attentively and smiling throughout the activity. Some
                            shared personal stories about food and how life used to be in their younger days, a time
                            when
                            resources were scarce and poverty made every piece of rice treasured. They told us they were
                            proud of us and glad to see young people caring about the environment.<br>

                            In many of the participants, some had vision difficulties, and some preferred Traditional
                            Taiwanese over Mandarin. To address these needs, we redesigned our materials with larger
                            fonts,
                            traditional Taiwanese characters, and bigger illustrations that explained food waste and BSF
                            in
                            simple steps. For those with eyesight or hearing difficulties, we adapted the content into
                            simpler oral storytelling with the aid of microphones. Moreover, recognizing that not
                            everyone
                            was comfortable with the pace of the lesson, we left a gap for a break for them to discuss
                            and
                            chat with us.<br>

                            These adjustments transformed the session into a link between two divergent generations. We
                            cannot guarantee that every elder fully understood our project, but hopefully, this kind of
                            experience encouraged them to stay curious, leaving a little yet lasting impact.<br>

                            <br>
                            Located on the southeastern tip of the Indian subcontinent, there is a country where
                            students
                            have limited insight into synthetic biology. To help resolve this lack of unexplored
                            knowledge
                            and unveil the mission to spread synthetic biology as far as we could, we went to Sri Lanka
                            for
                            nine days.<br>
                            <br>
                            This country has unresolved issues with resource limitations, especially in rural schools.
                            There
                            is a shortage of qualified teachers and outdated curricula that do not foster modern skills.
                            The
                            division between the rich and the poor is visible to the naked eye. This ongoing economic
                            crisis
                            has led to one of the world’s biggest issues: inequality in education. Being part of the
                            global
                            community, we want to help through a series of lectures that include information on
                            biodiversity, basic biology concepts, and the idea of the food chain. The reason that we
                            chose
                            these biological concepts instead of many other ideas is that our target audience is a group
                            of
                            young pupils. Given these circumstances, and assuming that they have limited prior knowledge
                            on
                            the given topic, we choose to start from the basics and add information gradually.<br>

                            We taught the kids through the assistance of English vocabulary, music, dancing, and
                            graphics. The structure of each class is backed by Team-Based Learning, in which they work
                            in teams and focus on collaboration to discuss the answer to each question posed by our
                            team. We understand that the traditional way of lecturing no longer fits the needs of the
                            21st-century students, and with that, we adopted this more efficient way of teaching.<br>
                            <br>
                            In the end, we conclude that the result of the class was a success as students were able to
                            fully incorporate the knowledge that they had learned in class and connect it to their
                            personal experience. Some related personal instances of raising organisms back home, sharing
                            their ideas as well as feelings towards the subject. Such outcomes indicate that the class
                            enhanced their knowledge about STEM and instilled curiosity to discover the interesting, yet
                            concealed, world they live in.<br>
