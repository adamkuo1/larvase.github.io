                        Our pricing strategy will be a combination of Cost-Plus Pricing and Value-based strategy. A
                        traditional Cost-Plus Pricing strategy adds a fixed profit margin on top of the average costs of
                        production, whereas a Value-Based strategy is based on data sets proving our product's benefits,
                        therefore raising the pricing.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For our marketing strategy, we add a fixed profit margin on top of production costs. Due to our
                        enzymes having a relatively lower cost than most commercial enzymes, our company generates a
                        greater profit margin compared to other companies in the industry. This fixed margin is
                        determined by the value-based strategy, where we picked a slightly higher price compared to
                        commercial enzymes. Our product has a higher degradation speed of food waste, specializing in
                        breaking down fibers that black soldier fly larvae can’t degrade. Besides this benefit, an
                        additional benefit from this supernatant is the change of black soldier flies it brings. The
                        theory of the supernatant is to pre-treat food waste. Since the pretreated food waste is then
                        digested by black soldier flies, by adding supernatants, this influences the diets of these
                        insects, which further shows a direct impact. By applying supernatants, the black soldier fly
                        larvae grow a higher proportion of proteins, making it a high-protein food source for livestock.
                        Through both pricing strategies, we are able to generate a great revenue from this product.

                        urban
                        and rural settings.
                        <br>
                        10. Utilize LarVase-purified cellulase to break down agro-waste into fermentable sugars for
                        sustainable biopolymer production, closing the loop between waste valorization and green
                        materials.
                        <br>
                        11. Serve as sourcing partners for LarVase’s raw waste inputs, creating a steady pipeline of
                        feedstock for BSFL rearing and enzyme application.
                        <br>
                        12. Incorporate protein-rich BSFL larvae enhanced by LarVase enzymes into sustainable fish and
                        livestock feed.
                        <br>
                        13. Partner with sugarcane and rice mills to upcycle bagasse, husks, and bran into BSFL
                        feedstock
                        for biodiesel, protein, and biopolymer production.

                        Although public awareness of GMOs in Taiwan is relatively high, understanding of synthetic
                        biology remains limited (Yeh et al., 2025), and many consumers express concerns on health and
                        environmental implications. This presents an opportunity: LarVase’s product is a purified
                        cellulolytic enzyme, not a live GMO organism, and therefore avoids much of the public and
                        regulatory resistance typically associated with GM solutions.

                        <br>
                        To further build public trust and institutional support, LarVase aligns with the national
                        direction set by Taiwan’s 5+2 Innovative Industries Plan, proposed in 2016 as "the central
                        driver of Taiwan’s industrial growth in the next era" (Executive Yuan, 2016). The plan
                        emphasizes seven strategic pillars—including "biomedicine … and the circular economy"—and offers
                        targeted support for startups and R&D in these fields. LarVase, as a biotech startup, qualifies
                        for these incentives. In particular, the YebF secretion method streamlines production, reducing
                        purification costs and shortening time-to-market, which is an ideal match with government
                        schemes designed to accelerate translational biotech from lab to industry.

                        By positioning our purified enzyme within Taiwan's high-priority biotech and circular economy
                        agenda, we strengthen:
                        <br>
                        • Product ~ market credibility: alignment with national innovation priorities
                        <br>
                        • Access to funding & infrastructure: through SME, biotech, and recycling grants
                        <br>
                        • Scalable deployment channels: via science parks and government programs
                        <br>
                        • Regulatory ease: clean, non-GMO product minimizes public resistance
