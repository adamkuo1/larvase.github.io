                    In the quiet hours just before dawn, when the world is still wrapped in the soft hush of sleep, there’s
                    a strange kind of peace that settles over everything. The streets, empty and dimly lit by flickering
                    lamps, seem to hold their breath as i  waiting for something miraculous to occur. It’s during this
                    liminal time, where night and day blur together, that thoughts often wander farther than usual. The
                    mind, unbothered by the day’s demands, begins to trac e old memories and strange imaginings with more
                    clarity. There’s something romantic about the way time slows down, how a single moment stretches and
                    wraps itself around you like a warm coat. The sound of a distant car engine or the rustle of trees in
                    the breeze becomes almost sacred.

                    You start to notice details usually overlooked: the grain of wood in a
                    park bench, the rhythmic chirping of crickets, or the faint scent of jasmine that someone planted years
                    ago and forgot. A cat slinks across the pavement, casting a long shadow under the orange glow of the
                    streetlamp. Somewhere nearby, a bakery begins its daily ritual, the smell of bread slowly mixing with
                    the cool air, reminding you of the comfort of simple things. It’s also a time when the big questions
                    surface—why are we here, what are we meant to do, who are we when no one is watching? The quiet makes
                    room for wonder, not anxiety. In those minutes before the sun breaks through the horizon, there’s a
                    shared stillness that feels almost like a secret, one that only a few early risers or sleepless minds
                    get to experience. Nature too seems to anticipate the arrival of light. Birds begin to stir in their
                    nests, sending out tentative calls as if checking if others are awake. The sky begins to shift subtly,
                    from charcoal gray to hints of blue and rose, painting the clouds with gentle color.

                    mind, unbothered by the day’s demands, begins to trac e old memories and strange imaginings with more
                    clarity. There’s something romantic about the way time slows down, how a single moment stretches and
                    wraps itself around you like a warm coat. The sound of a distant car engine or the rustle of trees in
                    the breeze becomes almost sacred.

                    You start to notice details usually overlooked: the grain of wood in a
                    park bench, the rhythmic chirping of crickets, or the faint scent of jasmine that someone planted years
                    ago and forgot. A cat slinks across the pavement, casting a long shadow under the orange glow of the
                    streetlamp. Somewhere nearby, a bakery begins its daily ritual, the smell of bread slowly mixing with
                    the cool air, reminding you of the comfort of simple things. It’s also a time when the big questions
                    surface—why are we here, what are we meant to do, who are we when no one is watching? The quiet makes
                    room for wonder, not anxiety. In those minutes before the sun breaks through the horizon, there’s a
                    shared stillness that feels almost like a secret, one that only a few early risers or sleepless minds
                    get to experience. Nature too seems to anticipate the arrival of light. Birds begin to stir in their
                    nests, sending out tentative calls as if checking if others are awake. The sky begins to shift subtly,
                    from charcoal gray to hints of blue and rose, painting the clouds with gentle color.
