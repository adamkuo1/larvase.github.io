                        For us, inclusivity is a guiding principle of our team. We believe inclusivity shapes the way we
                        work together and how we engage with others. We divided inclusivity into 2 sections: internal
                        inclusivity and external inclusivity. Separating inclusivity into these two aspects emphasizes
                        how inclusivity works in practice. The internal inclusivity ensures that members who are not
                        strongly interested in STEM can also contribute meaningfully to our project. This is the truly
                        interdisciplinary nature of synthetic biology and creates opportunities for members to grow in
                        unfamiliar fields. The external inclusivity is promoting synthetic biology and our project to
                        different age and minority groups and ensuring they can access and benefit from it.

                        • Why is this important for inclusivity?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Team inclusivity means each member in the group has a chance to contribute to the project,
                        regardless of their ability, background, or personality. For us, inclusivity is not only
                        gathering students from STEM fields but also embracing members interested in design and
                        education. These diverse voices in our team ensure that the team reflects the interdisciplinary
                        nature of synthetic biology itself. Moreover, this variety of groups can bring more creative
                        solutions due to the different perspectives of each person.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        • What did we do?
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To practice inclusivity, we divided each member into roles in the team and emphasized the
                        importance of everyone in our project. For example, we have divided our group into lab, human
                        practice, design, and website. The lab group focuses on experiments. The human practice group is
                        responsible for designing education plans and connecting with different stakeholders and
                        professors. The design group did all the wiki design, promotion video, and social media
                        management. For the website group, they have no prior knowledge on coding. However, we believe
                        that in the STEM field, the most important thing is passion and learning. We have decided to
                        give them the chance to self-learn and be responsible for our wiki.

                            <br>
                            To organize the team, we have set up regular team meetings every Saturday. Each group will
                            present updates, ensuring that technical results, design progress, and education outcomes
                            are
                            covered. The meeting facilitators will be our team leader, as it is convenient for our
                            leader to
                            integrate everyone’s progress. Furthermore, we held the cross-team workshops where STEM
                            members
                            explained scientific concepts to other members, while design members taught lab group
                            members
                            how to simplify complex experiment processes into engaging visuals. This exchange reinforced
                            mutual respect and reduced knowledge barriers between the groups. In this way, we reached a
                            balance in our team, where even members without lab experience could see their unique
                            impact,
                            and lab-focused members recognized the value of communication and creativity.

                            • Why is this important for inclusivity?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Team building activities are especially important for our team because our team is composed
                            of
                            teammates with different interests. In a diverse team like ours, communication styles and
                            skill
                            sets differ widely. In this situation, we had many misunderstandings and miscommunications.
                            This
                            team building is a chance for us to establish a bridge between each other. Our communication
                            efficiency and information correction rate will increase after people get used to each other
                            and
                            become familiar with each other's way of thinking and personality.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            • What did we do?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            From August 1st to 3rd, we organized a three-day team-building activity at a villa. Since
                            the
                            landscape is near the beach, we held a small iGEM Q&A competition on the beach. We also
                            distributed the team members randomly into 2 teams to promote interaction and collaboration
                            between each other. Furthermore, we held storytelling sessions where each member shared
                            their
                            motivation for joining iGEM and their reflections until now. These personal stories helped
                            us
                            understand each other, creating empathy and appreciation. These team building activities
                            also
                            include a small workshop, in which the lab group introduces the experimental protocol and
                            the
                            human practice group shares their concepts when they are designing their education plan. The
                            design team shared the methods they used when they were creating our figure. These
                            discussions
                            bring us more creative thought and make us understand everyone’s different ways of thinking.
                            To
                            ensure equal participation, we rotated leadership roles so every member had opportunities to
                            guide group activities. Evening reflection sessions encouraged members to share what they
                            learned about others, reinforcing the message that every background brought unique value to
                            the
                            team. By the end of the camp, we had not only built trust but also created a shared identity
                            as
                            a cohesive group.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This activity transformed how we collaborated with each other in the future assignments.
                            Previously, members only interacted with other groups because of the necessary needs. Now we
                            are
                            asking more questions and offering input more openly. The lab group gained new knowledge for
                            creative problem solving, and design and human practice members felt empowered to contribute
                            to
                            scientific discussions. As a result, our efficiency obviously increases with fewer
                            communication
                            gaps and more innovative solutions. Most importantly, the experience cultivated a sense of
                            belonging to our own team. Every member realized that inclusivity was not symbolic but truly
                            between us. Trust and unity are being carried forward into all the project stages.

                            Food insecurity is a global challenge that occurs every day across countries and
                            communities.
                            Some areas deal with a lot of leftovers, while others face shortages in daily life. We,
                            LarVase,
                            aim to tackle food insecurity directly, expanding the inclusivity of our project beyond the
                            lab
                            and even Taiwan, with the hope of sharing our vision with other countries.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In Southeast Asia, food insecurity is often experienced from disasters like typhoons and
                            floods
                            that damage crops and the fishing industry. At the same time, low-income families that live
                            in
                            high-cost-of-living areas struggle with rising food prices and often depend on cheap meals
                            that
                            are unhealthy. Thus, we created a rice donation program in Southeast Asia countries like
                            Vietnam
                            to help vulnerable communities.

                        “A Little for You, A Lot for Them”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To make this happen, we shared our vision with the Taiwanese community and showed them how
                        they
                        could join this international project by donating a little bit of money. This led to strong
                        support for our initiative. With these resources, our team can donate rice to families and
                        community kitchens that need it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Before the event started, we reached out to their local company, ChauThanhDat, which
                        generously
                        offered storage space for the rice and a place for us to rest. We also reached out to local
                        government officials to estimate how many rice bags we needed to prepare. Other than that,
                        the
                        local government also supported us by announcing and promoting this rice donation project.
                        We
                        prepared more than 100 large sacks of rice and distributed them across nearly 80
                        neighborhoods
                        where families struggled to have stable meals. We reached those most in need, including the
                        blind, disabled, and elderly individuals.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Additionally, we donated 8 sacks of rice to a local charity kitchen that provides meals for
                        children battling cancer.. According to the founder, she had devoted all she had to these
                        kids;
                        all of their parents could not afford the high cost of medication in Vietnam, leaving them
                        alone. One unforgettable moment was witnessing the unsanitary conditions of the kitchen. The
                        kitchen is an open cooking area, and all the ingredients were placed on the ground without
                        packages. The children were lining up to have some lunch outside the kitchen area, quietly
                        waiting for fried rice that contained simply eggs and ham.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Through the rice donation project, we supported over 120 individuals, including families and
                        residents relying on community kitchens. Families expressed relief at receiving staple food
                        that
                        eased their financial strain, while volunteers at the kitchen said our rice helped them
                        prepare
                        more consistent meals for marginalized groups. The impact on local people was significant;
                        they
                        appreciated that youth from another country recognized their struggles.
                        For the first time, we’re really diving into the issues that affect people. For our team,
                        this
                        experience showed the different aspects of food insecurity, triggered our sense of
                        responsibility, and reinforced that inclusivity involves a promise to address real needs.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Rather than a one-time activity, we see the rice donation project as the beginning of our
                        outreach.. In the future, we aim to collaborate with NGOs to provide support for vulnerable
                        communities across the world. By documenting our efforts, we hope to inspire other iGEM
                        teams to
                        do projects that truly make an impact on people, ensuring that inclusivity continues to grow
                        in
                        both technology and society.

                            Aside from informing more people about synthetic biology, another mission of our team is to
                            prioritize inclusivity. To be able to do that, we want to design and deliver a lecture where
                            everyone can understand what is going on without being confused or intimidated by complex
                            terms.
                            We also wanted to make the process of knowledge delivery fun because who would enjoy a
                            boring
                            lecture without sleeping out?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            With these factors in mind, we first list out all the potential concepts that we can deliver
                            to
                            our target audience. Through extensive choosing and ruling out all those unfit, eventually
                            we
                            found the perfect topics–basic biology terms, biodiversity, and the food chain. These
                            concepts
                            are neither too hard nor too easy, and through content adaptation, where we simplify
                            scientific
                            terms, they can process the information more efficiently. We also wanted them to work in
                            teams,
                            as through collaboration, they can learn from each other and make the learning process more
                            interactive instead of static.

                            In addition to implementing and taking care of those small details in the lecture, we also
                            encourage students to speak up during the lecture. No matter if they are right or wrong,
                            hearing
                            their voice is a crucial part of inclusivity, as being one of the global citizens, we value
                            contribution more for contribution than intelligence. We wanted to facilitate a safe
                            environment
                            that emphasizes curiosity, not correctness. As a result, more students feel empowered and no
                            longer see science as an unapproachable field, rather, they see it as a field that is
                            actively
                            part of life.

                            Reflecting on this experience in Sri Lanka, we feel lucky to have the opportunity to be able
                            to
                            educate them and probably open their future to a new domain. However, with the delivery of
                            the
                            lecture in mind, there are still many things that could be improved on. First, although
                            visuals
                            and accessible language support the concepts that we are trying to deliver, there are still
                            some
                            who are unable to keep up the pace and do not understand what we are trying to say. Given
                            this
                            issue, we suggest future iGEM teams who are about to do the same things as we are to provide
                            the
                            learning materials to be bilingual. On the other hand, we also noticed that while the
                            majority
                            of the students were enthusiastic, there were still some quieter participants who were less
                            vocal. Realizing that introverted people are also an important part of the community, we
                            suggest
                            that lecturers provide them with more assistance and guidance to accommodate and adjust to
                            their
                            needs to further inclusivity.
