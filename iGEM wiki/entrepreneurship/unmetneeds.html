                    <p class="text">
                        Food waste, often overlooked as a tiny fragment of human life, has evolved into one of the most
                        pressing global environmental challenges. It generates about "8-10 percent of annual global
                        greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions – almost 5 times that of the aviation sector – and significant
                        biodiversity loss by taking up the equivalent of almost a third of the world's agricultural
                        land" (UNFCCC, 2024). Beyond waste disposal, emissions accumulate across the entire supply
                        chain, including production, transportation and eventual decomposition sectors. This full cycle
                        significantly worsens climate change and magnifies the problem of food waste. In addition, the
                        U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) affirms that "over one-third of the food produced in
                        the United States is never eaten, wasting the resources used to produce it and creating a myriad
                        of environmental impacts." For instance, the water devoted to crop irrigation simply goes to
                        waste; the energy used during harvesting and processing never yields benefit. But beyond
                        environmental impacts, food waste also carries significant economic and biological challenges
                        that are urgent to address.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Economically, food waste is a major burden. The EPA also reports that the cost of food waste to
                        American consumers averages about $728 per year and for a household of four, the annual cost is
                        $2913, which highly contributes to the inefficiency of the economy. According to the research
                        paper published by Katarzyna Slopiecka, a researcher at the University of Perugia, Department of
                        Engineering, in 2022, the structured regression line indicates a negative inverse relationship
                        between national GDP and the composition of organic food waste. This provides insights into
                        targeting our solution towards varied socioeconomic contexts. Moreover, current solutions are
                        limited in effectiveness and risk of introducing additional contaminants. There are emerging
                        issues with food waste management, where a rising concern of food waste recycling contains
                        levels of plastic and persistent chemical contaminants, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl
                        substances (PFAS), in food waste streams.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The biological composition of food waste also poses a huge challenge for treatment. It is
                        primarily made up of carbohydrates (41-62%), proteins (15-25%), and lipids (13-30%), and
                        carbohydrates are further broken down into cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, starch, and fiber
                        (Katarzyna Slopiecka, 2022). These organic components, along with other unbreakable compounds,
                        make up a significant portion of the total organic compounds in food waste, thus contributing to
                        the main goal of the team’s project. Those complex polysaccharides, especially cellulose and
                        lignin, resist enzymatic degradation, which poses a challenge for Black Soldier Fly Larvae
                        (BSFL) to digest. The insect is polyphagous, which consumes all types of organic materials of
                        animals and plants (Bava et al., 2019), Diener et al (2011) showed that BSF can be used to
                        convert municipal waste with a reduction rate ranging from 65.6 to 78.9%. However, the natural
                        gut microbiota lack the enzymes needed to efficiently break down plant cell walls, which limits
                        its digestion speed and nutrient extraction from plant-based food wastes. These limitations
                        raise concerns about current waste management systems (both in Taiwan and globally), therefore
                        introducing the market gap that our team, LarVase, plans to address.

                        Taiwan and the global waste management markets are different in both scale and growth
                        trajectory. Compared to the global market, Taiwan accounts for only a tiny portion of the global
                        market; nevertheless, its projected growth is comparatively faster. Hence, to evaluate Taiwan’s
                        relative position in the global market, the following table shows the key metrics from 2023 to
                        2030, including market size, growth rate, and segment focus, etc.

                        Based on the graph, Taiwan contains advanced recycling mechanics, a strong organic focus, and a
                        high CAGR, which makes it an ideal location for LarVase’s enzyme-enhanced fiber degradation
                        solution. The market data indicate that current systems in Taiwan rely on Black Soldier Fly
                        Larvae (BSFL), which is one of the most widely used and efficient methods for converting organic
                        food waste into protein and composts (Circular Taiwan Network, 2025). However, such techniques
                        struggle to process fiber-rich organic wastes such as vegetables, fruit peels, and
                        cellulose-heavy scraps. Within this current biological gap in Taiwan’s highly regulated system,
                        LarVase holds the potential for local deployment and eventual scale-up.

                        Fiber is primarily composed of "complex, non-starch carbohydrates and lignin that are not
                        digestible within the small intestine because mammals do not produce enzymes capable of
                        hydrolyzing them into their constituent monomers" (Turner & Lupton, 2011). As a result, fiber is
                        structurally tough and resistant to degradation. The most common industrial and municipal
                        methods to process fibrous organic waste include:

                        As the graph illustrates, current industrial methods for fiber degradation each come with
                        significant limitations, such as slowness, incompleteness, energy intensity, etc. Notably, none
                        of these methods are efficient and scalable enough for current use in BSFL-based systems, which
                        dominate Taiwan’s food waste management market. Thus, there is a clear unmet need: a lower-cost,
                        biologically compatible solution that allows the breakdown of fibers without changing the
                        existing infrastructure much. Our company, LarVase, fills this gap as we combine synthetic
                        biology with targeted enzyme production, which serves as a scalable pretreatment step that
                        directly enhances BSFL efficiency and addresses a fundamental weakness in the current system.

                        farms processing food waste into animal feed or compost are ideal early adopters. They directly

                        the challenges of fiber digestion inefficiency and would benefit from a plug-in enzyme solution
